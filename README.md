# UAV-LAnding-on-wobble-surface
Developed a vision-based system for autonomous drone landing on moving surfaces using CNN and LSTM/xLSTM to predict future motion. Evaluated in a Gazebo simulation, achieving accurate landing safety predictions with noted real-time latency constraints.
contributed in next frame prediction using CNN+LSTM model
